# Peer review: Mini project by Zariza Chowdhury 

## Reproducibility Report
### I was unable to run the analysis without modifying the code 2 times. 
### I added 'import matplotlib.pyplot as plt' to enable plotting. 
### replaced 'cut_counts' with 'cut_values' since I was getting an error saying that counts was not defined. 

## Overall Opinion
### The project is well-structured and easy to to navigate.
### README.md provides a clear overview.
### Code is mostly clean and readable.
### Git usage is solid, with meaningful commit messages and a logical progression.

## Suggested Improvements
### Double-check variable names to avoid confusion
### Consider including a sample output image in the README to preview the analysis result.
